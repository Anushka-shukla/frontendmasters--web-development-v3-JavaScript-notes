## Control Flow & Loops

- The condition inside of the parenthesis is evaluated and if it's true, the first block is run and the second is skipped.
```
const skyIsBlue = true;

if (skyIsBlue) {
  console.log("The sky is blue!");
} else {
  console.log("The sky is â€¦ not blue?");
}
```

See [index.js](index.js) control flow section for more egs.
